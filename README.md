This is my near finished version of the Studio in LaunchCode to write a test taking program. To view the assignment view this link.

This has a lot of bugs and loose ends that need to be cleaned up, but the functionality is all there. This project really helped me put together a lot of ideas 
and I thought it was a great exercise in putting these ideas and concepts into practice. 

If you try this code out, I would love to hear your thoughts. I am open to constructive critisim and things I should be on the look out for in terms of observing
best practices. This is the most complex code I have wrote so far (2/2/2023) and I still have a long way to go in my learning with LaunchCode and beyond.
